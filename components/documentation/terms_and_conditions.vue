                    <br/>
                    <p> If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, it will be revised
                      and interpreted to achieve the intended purpose to the fullest extent permitted by law,
                      and the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable. Waiver of any breach of
                      these Terms does not waive the right to enforce such terms in the future, nor does it
                      affect the ability to enforce any subsequent breach thereafter.</p>
