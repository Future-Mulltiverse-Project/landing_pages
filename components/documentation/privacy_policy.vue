                      subcontractors as necessary to provide you with our products and/or services. These
                      parties include companies and individuals who perform functions on our behalf, such as

                      providing customer service, offering products and/or services, promotions, and
                      marketing assistance. Each of these parties is bound by a duty of confidentiality,
                      meaning they are legally obligated to protect your information and use it only for the
                      purposes for which it was disclosed. Working with these trusted partners allows us to

                        you enter, submit, or access it. We use encryption to transfer and store your personal
                        information whenever possible. We also limit access to your personal information
                        through access controls and confidentiality commitments. While we strive to maintain
                        reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal
                        information obtained through our Site and the Tools, we cannot completely ensure or
                        warrant the security of any personal information you transmit to us.</p>

                      <li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g., statutory retention obligations, such as tax or accounting requirements);</li>
                      <li>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <p> When we no longer need your personal data, we will securely delete or anonymize it. If
                        deletion is not possible due to exceptional circumstances, we will securely store your

                    <br/>
                    <p>We do not direct or target our Site or the Tools to anyone under the legal age of majority
                        who lack the legal capacity under any applicable laws (“Child”, or “Children”). We do

                        of their parents or guardians. If we learn that we have collected or received personal
                        information from a Child without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to
                        delete that personal information.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p> Third-party providers may place cookies or pixels—small data files stored on your hard
                        drive or in your device's memory—on your browser. These cookies and pixels are used
                        to collect information about your online activities and preferences. Most web browsers
                        are set to accept cookies by default, as they help enhance your browsing experience by
                        remembering your preferences and providing personalized content. However, you can
                        generally adjust your browser settings to remove or reject cookies. Each browser has
                        different methods for managing these settings, so you may need to refer to your
                        browser's help section for detailed instructions. If you choose to remove or reject cookies,
                        it may impact your ability to fully utilize the Site or the Tools. Certain features and
                        functionalities may not work as intended, and your overall experience may be affected.
                        For example, you may need to manually adjust some preferences each time you visit the
                        Site, and some services and features may not be available to you. It is important to note
                        that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by these third parties,
                        as we do not control their activities or data practices. We recommend reviewing the
                        privacy policies of any third-party websites or services you interact with to understand
                        howthey use cookies and pixels, and what data they collect
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-left" >13. Change of control</h4>
                    <br/>

                        control, personal information may be transferred to a third-party. In such events, your
                        personal information may be part of the assets transferred or acquired. We will take
                        steps to ensure that any transfer of your personal information is conducted in
                        accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations, and we will notify you
                        of any such transfer as required by law.</p>

                    <br/>
                    <p> We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to review it
